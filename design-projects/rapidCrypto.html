                    <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rapid Crypto is an application developed in a 5-person team for our Mobile Computing Project. The objective 
                        of this project was to create a interesting and useful app that targets any user-groups of our choosing.

                    <h4>PROMPT</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular and valuable over the last few years, and some believe it may 
                        even replace traditional currency in the future. However, investing in cryptocurrency can be intimidating for 
                        newcomers.

                    <h4>OUR ROLE</h4>
                    <p>              
                        Our goal was to primarily target users who want to learn how to utilize cryptocurrency. Inexperienced users are 
                        scared to invest their money due to the risky nature of the crypto market. Thus, by creating a safe and realistic 
                        environment that mimics a crypto exchange app, we are allowing users to become familiar with the many ways in which
                        these currencies/coins are acquired and exchanged.

                    <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are several applications in this space already that come up short. Many are extremely basic, lacking in depth portfolio 
                        management and trade history, or are limited to only a few very popular coins. We chose three potential competitors to analyze: 
                        <span class="color"><b> Bitcoin Flip</b></span>, <span class="color"><b>Fake Crypto Investor</b></span>, and <span class="color"><b>Cryptomania</b></span>.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./imgs/rapidCrypto/img-4.png">
                    <p>
                        <span class="color"><b>Cryptomania</b></span> is an application that more closely resembles what we hope to accomplish, however as stated in its description users don’t 
                        buy and sell coins as they would on a real exchange. Instead, it’s more like they wager on whether the price of a coin will rise or fall. Rapid Crypto will have all the 
                        basic functionality you'd expect to see in a real cryptocurrency exchange application, including login, profile management, buying and selling crypto, a coin watchlist, 
                        crypto conversion, and more. Additionally, Simulator Cryptocurrency trading leverages advertisements in a way that interrupts a smooth user experience, offering users more 
                        account credit if they watch advertisements. Rapid Crypto on the other hand isn’t about maxing out your portfolio or needing watch ads to receive funds. It’s designed for 
                        users to practice in whatever way helps them improve their trading skills and avoiding arbitrary hurdles that encourage watching ads just so they can continue using the app.

                    <p>
                        In creating this cryptocurrency trading application, there are several aspects and basic functions that must be included. 
                        So, we decided on keeping the below features as minimum functionality.

                    <p>
                        For making the application more useful to the users, we need to provide some more functionalities which help the user to decide 
                        on choosing which cryptocurrency to buy, track their portfolio (previously bought cryptocurrencies along with current prices) and 
                        sell already bought cryptocurrencies. So, we decided to implement the below features as expected functionality.

                    We followed agile methodology for this application development, we updated each user story to a finished state after all 
                    of the modifications meet our definition of done. Each user story contained a set of acceptance tests that must be passed 
                    before going on to the next user story.

                    The Rapid Crypto colour palette is analogous, mainly consisting of different shades of purple and blue. Before choosing this colour scheme, 
                    research was done on the psychology behind colours. Purple mixes the vibrancy of red with the calmness of blue, and gives an uplifting effect 
                    to users. We also chose these colors and designed the app in a way to promote for gender inclusivity. We aim to create a product that is as 
                    equally engaging, useful, and effective for as many users as possible.
