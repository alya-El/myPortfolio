                    <p>
                        Runella is a product concept that came to life through my CSCI 3160 User Interface Design course at 
                        Dalhousie University. The objective of this project is to create an aesthetic app that provides a 
                        platform for people to find jogging buddies in their area so they never have to exercise alone.

                    <p>
                        Given the rapid rates of morbid obesity in Canada and the US, it is safe to assume that low physical 
                        activity is a widespread phenomenon. The effects of lack of activity is catastrophic and affects millions 
                        of people. Here are some key numbers of Obesity in the US:

                        While searching for reasons people do not exercise or keep up with their fitness goals, I found that lack of 
                        accountability was a common reason. Thus, this research led to my initial question: 
                        <span class="color">How do we motivate people to stay active by holding them accountable?</span>

                            their features, I summarized some usage pain points, which became the opportunity areas for me when designing Runella.

                        <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
                        <p>
                            To better understand our potential users, I conducted user research using the ACM digital library. I also interviewed 5 
                            physically active people aging 20 to 40. the interview was semi-structured and open-ended so people are able to share 
                            details of their exercise habits, how they motivate themselves to exercise, and what usually causes them to fall off track. 
                            After conducting the user research, I found out most age groups between 15 to 24 years were amongst the age ranges that had 
                            the lowest physical activity rate. Additionally, prevalence of low physical activity was higher in females than in males. 
                            I also found the common cause for failing to excise regularly is redundancy/boredom and lack of accountability (no one pushing 
                            them to remain consistent with their exercise, such as a personal trainer).

                            As a team, we conducted an initial brainstorming/evaluation cycle using sketches and storyboards. The goal of this task was 
                            communicate a unique application concept through sketches. At the end of this activity, we discussed our proposals and sketched 
                            a hybrid concept.

                            Fixing issues with high severity (most important) were prioritized in the development process. For example, many users had trouble creating a group while using our prototype. This feature is part of our minimal functionality, thus it was prioritized. Fixing these issues were important so that the upcoming usability testing will show us already if further changes or improvements are needed.

Before choosing this colour scheme, research was done on the psychology behind colours. Purple mixes the vibrancy of red with the calmness of blue, and gives an uplifting effect to users.
